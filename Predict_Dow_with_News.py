# # Predicting the Dow Jones with News

# The goal of this project is to use the top, daily news headlines from Reddit to predict the movement of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The data for this project spans from 2008-08-08 to 2016-07-01, and is from this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/aaron7sun/stocknews). 
# 
# The news from a given day will be used to predict the difference in opening price between that day, and the following day. This method is chosen because it should allow all of the day's news to be incorporated into the price compared to closing price, which could only incorporate the day's morning and afternoon news.
# 
# For this project, we will use GloVe to create our word embeddings and CNNs followed by LSTMs to build our model. This model is based off the work done in this paper https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C/C16/C16-1229.pdf.

# As we can see from the data above, this model struggles to accurately predict the change in the opening price of the Dow Jones Instrustial Average. Given that its median average error is 74.15 and the interquartile range of the actual price change is 142.16 (87.47 + 54.69), this model is about as good as someone who knows the average price change of the Dow. 
# 
# I have a few ideas for why this model struggles:
# - The market is arguably to be a random walk. Although there is some direction to its movements, there is still quite a bit of randomness to its movements.
# - The news that we used might not be the most relevant. Perhaps it would have been better to use news relating to the 30 companies that make up the Dow.
# - More information could have been included in the model, such as the previous day(s)'s change, the previous day(s)'s main headline(s). 
# - Many people have worked on this task for years and companies spend millions of dollars to try to predict the movements of the market, so we shouldn't expect anything too great considering the small amount of data that we are working with and the simplicity of our model.

# ## Make Your Own Predictions

# Below is the code necessary to make your own predictions. I found that the predictions are most accurate when there is no padding included in the input data. In the create_news variable, I have some default news that you can use, which is from April 30th, 2017. Just change the text to whatever you want, then see the impact your new headline will have.

    ints = []
    for word in news.split():

            ints.append(vocab_to_int[word])
        else:
            ints.append(vocab_to_int['<UNK>'])
    return ints

            padded_news.append(vocab_to_int["<PAD>"])

        padded_news = padded_news[:max_daily_length]
